A landing page project in web development involves creating a standalone web page designed to capture a visitor's attention and drive them toward a  specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter, downloading a resource, or purchasing a product. These pages are focused on a single goal,   often linked to marketing campaigns, and are optimized for conversion. They typically include compelling headlines, engaging visuals, concise and persuasive copy, and a clear call to action (CTA).
